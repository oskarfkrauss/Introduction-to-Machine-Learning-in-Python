    "The second task is to try and come up with the best fitting model for the white wine dataset which we used a few weeks ago.First you need to create a new directory called ```data``` which we will use to store the data. In the command line run:\n",

    "I have given you some starter code so that you can use polynomial basis expansion and L1 or L2 regularization, everything in this part should be implemented with scitkit-learn.
